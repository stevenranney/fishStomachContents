* 25 Jan 2018 - Files in the `/R` dir are undergoing significant updates. Given that this code was last reviewed in June 2014, I've been doing some refactoring and combining when possible. As a result, the likelihood of `stomach.R` disappearing and the contents of `walleye.R` and `smallmouth.R` being combined is very high. `helper_functions.R` will see additions as necessary.
